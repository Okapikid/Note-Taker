# Note-Taker

## Note-Taker

This project utilized Express.js to create a note-taking app that will retrieve note data from a JSON file<br>
When a user loads the application they begin at a landing page. Clicking through, they are brought to a notes page in which they can create new notes with a title and text.<br>
<br>
After recording their note they can click on the save icon to save the note.<br>
<br>
By clicking on a previously recorded note in the left-hand column the note will appear in the right-hand column.
<br>
The deployed application can be found here: [link to deployed application](https://morning-sierra-39247.herokuapp.com/)
